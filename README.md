# Artists and Collectors Staking

## III. Liquidity Mining

To incentivize active use of the NeftyBlocks platform, we introduce a liquidity mining program. Every Wednesday, 150,000 $NEFTY tokens will be distributed to people who have interacted with the NeftyBlocks platform during the previous week.

The Liquidity Mining tokens will be initially distributed as follows:

* 50% to Buyers
* 50% to Sellers

### Buyers Liquidity Mining
Every wallet that buys NFTs on the NeftyBlocks platform will participate in liquidity mining and will receive a proportional share of the Liquidity Mining tokens allocated to buyers.
When buyers use $NEFTY to pay for their NFTs they will boost their Liquidity Mining rewards by 100% compared to those who choose to pay with WAX. Their Liquidity Mining power is thus doubled.

Additionally, wallets staking $NEFTY will be able to boost their Liquidity Mining power even further according to their staking level.

Wallet Staking Level | Multiplier | $NEFTY Requirements
-|-|-
Level 0 * | 1 | 0
Level 1 | 1.25 | 1000
Level 2 | 1.5 | 4000
Level 3 | 2 | 10000

**Wallets not staking $NEFTY*

### Artist Liquidity Mining
Every collection that has sold NFTs using NeftyBlocks drops will participate in liquidity mining and will receive a share of the Liquidity Mining tokens allocated to sellers.
By staking $NEFTY and using Nefty Drops exclusively, sellers can boost their liquidity mining power as specified in the table below.


Collection Staking Level | Multiplier | $NEFTY Requirements
-|-|-
Level 0 * | 1 | 0
Level 1 | 2 | 10000
Level 2 | 2.5 | 25000
Level 3 | 3 | 45000

**Collections not staking $NEFTY*

**The staking level is determined at the beginning of each liquidity mining period.**
